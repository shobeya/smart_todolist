SMART TO-DO LIST WITH TASK PRIORITIZATION
PROJECT OVERVIEW
     The Smart To-Do List with Task Prioritization is an AI-powered application built using Python, NLP, and Streamlit. It allows users to input tasks, and the AI assigns priority levels (High, Medium, or Low) based on urgency and importance. The prioritized tasks are then displayed in a structured manner to help users manage their workflow efficiently.

 KEY FEATURES
	User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive UI.
	 AI-Powered Prioritization: Uses NLP techniques (TextBlob) to determine the priority of tasks.
	 Task Input & Display: Users can enter tasks, and tasks are sorted by priority in real-time.
	Automated Sorting: Ensures high-priority tasks appear at the top.

TECH STACK
•	Python (Primary language)
•	Streamlit (UI framework)
•	NLP Library: TextBlob (for sentiment-based prioritization)

 HOW IT WORKS
1️. User enters a task in the input field.
2️. The AI processes the task using TextBlob NLP to determine urgency.
3️. The task is assigned a priority: High, Medium, or Low.
4️. The to-do list displays all tasks sorted by priority.

INSTALLATION & SETUP
1.	Clone the repository (if applicable) or save the script.
2.	Install dependencies: 
3.	pip install streamlit textblob
4.	Run the application: 
5.	streamlit run todo_ui.py
FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
•	Implement Deadline & Due Dates
•	Add Task Categories (Work, Personal, Urgent, etc.)
•	Store tasks in a database for persistence
•	Improve NLP accuracy with spaCy/BERT

 CONCLUSION
      This project showcases AI-driven task prioritization using NLP in a simple yet powerful To-Do List application. It highlights the integration of Python, Streamlit, and TextBlob, making it an excellent addition to any resume for AI and software development roles.
